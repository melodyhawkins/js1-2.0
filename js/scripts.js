Codepen is better than JBin

Let's Try It - Done.
Scripting language
Basic tenents:
loosley typed language
DOM manipulator - takes the visual representation and manipulates it;
Object oriented - basically all programming that you do will usually fall under two categories - object or functional. JS in its best form is object oriented = exact same piece of code can be applied in various places and same result.
Essential for building a modern dynamic website.
Console - use to test that it worked.
Conventions - Best Practices
camelCasing - variables and functions
Variables - tells the computer through the browser to save this part of the memory and when i say the name put the value to it.
once you declare a variable, you need to define it.

*/
//DECLARE A VARIABLE
var firstName;
firstName = "Melody";//"String" or 'String'

//DEFINE AND DECLARE A VARIABLE
var lastName = "Hawkins";
console.log(firstName, lastName);

//REDEFINE THE VARIABLE
firstName = 'Superman'; //be consistent with use of quotation marks
console.log(firstName);

/*
Scoped indenting - Best Practices
Anytime you see curly brackets, typically inside that curly bracket is a new scope. Because of that you will always have a single tab to start off your code.
JS Statements should be terminated with a semicolon:
  definition, declaration, or combination of both
  console log;
  function
ES6 - current fully supported version of JS
